            <h2>How to play ?</h2>
            <p>
                I's very easy and pleasurable.Don't run the snake into the walls, or his own tail: you will die.Use your arrow keys on the
                keyboard: up, left, right, and down or use the control panel ocated on right side on our screen.
                <br><br>
                There is two main buttons "Play" and "Pause", eat the colored snails to gain points and grow.Higher (and faster) play levels award more points.The
                high score wroted under your current score on panel, when you gain score grather than the highest one your score will
                be highest one.You can change game area background color from color palette button, you can also add guide lines by clicking
                on "Guide lines" checkbox and if you like to playing in harder or easier mode you have to change the difficulty on the
                panel.If you need to refresh the game without closing, you can click on "Restart" button under menu bar -> Tools -> Restart
                also for exiting you have a button in same path.
            </p>
